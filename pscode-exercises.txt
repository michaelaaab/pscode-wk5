// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

DEFINE the two numbers

	x = 2
	y = 5

SUM is defined as the addition of x and y

	sum = x + y

THEREFORE the sum of the two numbers is calculated as

	sum = 2 + 5
	sum = 7

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF number is % 2 = 0 then even
	ELSE is odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are


DEFINE the five separate integers
	
	int1 = Randomly generate int1 
	int2 = Check value of int1, then randomly generate noncompeteing int2
	int3 = Check value of previous integers, then randomly generate noncompeting int3
	int4 = Check value of previous integers, then randomly generate noncompeting int4
	int5 = Check value of previous integers, then randomly generate noncompeting int5

CALCULATE average of the five integers as

	Average = (int1 + int2 + int3 + int4 + int5) % 5

DEFINE the minimum and maximum of the five integers as

	min = check for smallest integer value (int1, int2, int3, int4, int5)
	max = check for greatest integer value (int1, int2, int3, int4, int5)

IF average, print "This is the average of the five numbers"

IF min, print "This is the smallest of the five numbers"

If max, print "This is the largest of the five numbers"
